# 🚍 Transportation Visualization

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing public transportation data in the Vancouver metropolitan area. Through interactive maps and visual plots, the project provides insights into transit frequency, trip patterns, and route structures, supporting better urban planning and transit system optimization.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple dimensions of transit data:

- **Trip Counts** by `day_of_week` and `hour_of_day`
- **Bus Stop Metadata** such as `stop_id`, `stop_name`, `stop_lat`, `stop_lon`, and `bus_frequency`
- **Route Information** including `route_id`, `route_name`, and stop sequences with directionality

---

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **GeoPandas & Folium** for interactive maps
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data processing and visualization

---

## 📍 Project Highlights

- Identified **peak commute hours** across weekdays and weekends.
- Mapped **route flows and congestion points**.
- Highlighted **busiest bus stops and corridors** using geospatial heatmaps.
- Produced clear, interactive visual insights suitable for **transit planning**.

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add user interactivity with **Dash or Streamlit**
- Integrate real-time GPS transit feeds
- Deploy as a **web dashboard** for public use
