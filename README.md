# 🚍 Transportation Visualization

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing public transportation data in the Vancouver metropolitan area. Through interactive maps and visual plots, the project provides insights into transit frequency, trip patterns, and route structures, supporting better urban planning and transit system optimization.

---

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes multiple dimensions of transit data:

- **Trip Counts** by `day_of_week` and `hour_of_day`
- **Bus Stop Metadata** such as `stop_id`, `stop_name`, `stop_lat`, `stop_lon`, and `bus_frequency`
- **Route Information** including `route_id`, `route_name`, and stop sequences with directionality

---

## 📌 Key Visualizations

### 🔹 1. Trip Count by Hour and Day of Week
Displays the number of trips happening across different hours and days.

### 🔹 2. Top 10 High-Frequency Bus Stops
Bus stops with the highest recorded bus frequencies.

---

### 🔹 3. Bus Stop Heatmap
A heatmap indicating the density of bus stops across the Greater Vancouver Area.

### 🔹 6. Route Segment Data
Detailed breakdown of each bus route segment including:
- Stop sequences
- Coordinates
- Direction (East/West)

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **GeoPandas & Folium** for interactive maps
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data processing and visualization

---

## 📍 Project Highlights

- Identified **peak commute hours** across weekdays and weekends.
- Mapped **route flows and congestion points**.
- Highlighted **busiest bus stops and corridors** using geospatial heatmaps.
- Produced clear, interactive visual insights suitable for **transit planning**.

---

## 🧠 Future Improvements

- Add user interactivity with **Dash or Streamlit**
- Integrate real-time GPS transit feeds
- Deploy as a **web dashboard** for public use
